To install solar panels as an amateur, consider the following key DIY suggestions based on the search results:

1. **Understand the Basics**: Before starting, it's crucial to have a basic understanding of solar energy and how solar panels work. This knowledge will help you build an efficient and cost-effective system tailored to your energy needs[5].

2. **Gather Materials**: Start by gathering all necessary materials for the installation, including solar panels, an inverter, a charge controller (if using batteries), batteries (optional for on-grid solar), wiring, and mounting hardware. Ensure compatibility among the components and with the size of your system[5].

3. **Install Charge Controller and Inverter**: Begin by installing the charge controller to regulate electricity flow in and out of your battery bank, and the inverter to convert DC power from solar panels into AC power for home use[5].

4. **Mount Solar Panels**: Securely mount your solar panels on the roof or in a sunny location in your yard following the manufacturer's instructions closely. Connect the panels to the charge controller, then connect the charge controller to the battery bank using properly sized wire and protection. Finally, connect the inverter to the battery bank and main electrical panel[5].

5. **Connect to the Grid**: If you aim to sell excess electricity back to the grid, you'll need a grid-tied solar power system. Obtain approval from your local utility company and follow their guidelines for setup. Off-grid systems do not require a utility interconnection but still need proper setup[5].

By following these steps and guidelines, you can successfully install solar panels as an amateur. Remember to prioritize safety, carefully follow instructions, and seek professional assistance if needed during any part of the installation process.
